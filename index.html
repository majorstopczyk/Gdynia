            It was not until 1253, however, that the first reference was made to the village named Gdynia, which was located at the Chyloński Potok estuary to the Baltic sea (in old records the name of the village was Gdina). The village had a fishing harbour and a boathouse. In the documents of Wolimir, the then Kujavian Bishop, one can find a note that Gdynia belonged to the parish of Oksywie (the first church on the this part of the Baltic Sea coast).
